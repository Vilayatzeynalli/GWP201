    <h2>House Blend Coffee</h2>
    <img src="house-blend.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="">
    <p>Coffee is consumed worldwide – the industry ranges from the growth, production, and distribution. There are so many different blends, brands, and beans that it can be difficult to understand what can make each cup of coffee different from the other. A blend of coffee is the result of combining two different beans to produce different flavors and strengths. Blends are not standardized in the coffee industry, making it difficult to fully grasp the core differences between cups. In order to define a House Blend coffee, you must first understand the basic components of roasting coffee.</p>

    <h2>French Roats</h2>

    <p>Simply put, “French roast” describes the color of the coffee beans after they have been roasted. These interesting beans are on the darker end of the scale, and are usually the color of dark chocolate. It does not mean the coffee was grown or roasted in France (although yes, that is where the roasting style originated in the 1800s).</p>

    <h2>Columbian Roats</h2>

    <p>Colombia is famous for growing some of the best coffee beans. The coffee plant thrives under the shade of banana trees in a tropical climate. The way the beans grow, is shaped by Colombia’s high altitude. The country produces plenty of coffee and exports a lot of its best beans. You could get your hands on Colombian single-origin coffee and start brewing! 

        Before that, let's tell you why it's so special. The unique flavors and strong aroma makes Colombian coffee a favorite for many. Coffee culture is unique across the number of countries that love it. When we talk about Colombian coffee, we are not talking about a roasting or brewing method but how it is grown. Colombia is a near-perfect coffee-growing climate. That is, it produces a specific type of bean from the environment. </p>
